An extension of T-par to deal with arbitrary rotations.
Most of the options of T-par don't work yet, but it will optimize
circuits with arbitrary Z rotations in the general way.

The syntax is the same as regular T-par .qc, with the addition
of the gate Rz([-]ID/2^k). Rz specifies a rotation along the z
axis of the bloch sphere, the leading minus sign is optional,
ID is some string standing in for an arbitrary angle with "pi"
representing the (mathematical) pi, and k is an arbitrary integer.
So, for example, Rz(pi/2^2) gives the standard T gate, and
Rz(-pi/2^2) gives the T* gate.

T-par will attempt to merge and parallelize those phase gates
in the same "syntactic class", in that rotations along angles
known to be related by powers of 2 can be merged and parallelized.
In a production version phase gates in different syntactic classes
would be parallelized together, but this should be sufficient for
some experiments.

For a demo, check out demos/controlled_Rz.qc.
